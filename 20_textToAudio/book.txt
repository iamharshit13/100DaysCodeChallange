OUR DEEPEST FEAR IS NOT THAT WE ARE INADEQUATE. OUR DEEPEST FEAR IS THAT WE ARE POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE. IT IS OUR LIGHT, NOT OUR DARKNESS THAT MOST FRIGHTENS US. WE ASK OURSELVES, WHO AM I TO BE BRILLIANT, GORGEOUS, TALENTED, FABULOUS? ACTUALLY, WHO ARE YOU NOT TO BE? YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD. YOUR PLAYING SMALL DOES NOT SERVE THE WORLD. THERE IS NOTHING ENLIGHTENED ABOUT SHRINKING SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE WONâ€™T FEEL INSECURE AROUND YOU. WE ARE ALL MEANT TO SHINE, AS CHILDREN DO
 
 
 
 
Next:  
THE VISION THAT YOU GLORIFY IN YOUR MIND, THE IDEAL THAT YOU ENTHRONE IN YOUR HEART, THIS YOU WILL BUILD YOUR LIFE BY, AND THIS YOU WILL BECOME.
 
 
 
Next: 
SECURITY IS MOSTLY A SUPERSTITION. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN NATURE, NOR DO THE CHILDREN OF MEN AS A WHOLE EXPERIENCE IT. AVOIDING DANGER IS NO SAFER IN THE LONG RUN THAN OUTRIGHT EXPOSURE. LIFE IS EITHER A DARING ADVENTURE, OR NOTHING.
 
 
 
 
Next: 
THE FISHING IS BEST WHERE THE FEWEST GO, AND THE COLLECTIVE INSECURITY OF THE WORLD MAKES IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO HIT HOME RUNS WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS AIMING FOR BASE HITS. THERE IS JUST LESS COMPETITION FOR BIGGER GOALS. IF YOU ARE INSECURE, GUESS WHAT? THE REST OF THE WORLD IS, TOO. DO NOT OVERESTIMATE THE COMPETITION AND UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF. YOU ARE BETTER THAN YOU THINK.
 
 
 

Next:  
I DO NOT HAVE SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE OR FAULTLESS LOOKS. I DO NOT CAPTIVATE A ROOM OR RUN A MILE UNDER SIX MINUTES. I ONLY SUCCEEDED BECAUSE I WAS STILL WORKING AFTER EVERYONE ELSE WENT TO SLEEP.

 
 
 Thankyou
